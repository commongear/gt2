This work was written by commongear, based on knowledge gathered by, and
inspired by the excellent work of [pez2k](https://github.com/pez2k/gt2tools)
and [adeyblue](https://github.com/adeyblue/GTVolTools).

Right now it handles a subset of GT2 files, but I might consider extending it
to new file types or titles with similar formats. It consists of:

1. Browser-based [OBJ viewer](./view/).
2. Cross-platform C++ [command line tool](./extract/) to extract files.

This project doesn't focus on re-packing files to a new VOL, as the community is
pretty good at that already (see the repos linked above). Rather, it's
interested in the archaeology of the files and formats on disk, converting them
to more commonly viewable and editable formats.
